## Welcome to My GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Carol, a PhD candidate specializing in cybersecurity. My research focuses on leveraging Digital Twin technology to detect Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) targeting Cyber-Physical Systems in smart manufacturing environments.

Currently, I'm working with various Siemens software and hardware to set up an ICS testbed for threat simulation and detection.

I'm eager to collaborate with fellow researchers and industry professionals on projects related to:
- Digital Twins of Cyber-physical Systems
- Cybersecurity in Industrial Control Systems
- Detection and mitigation of APTs
- Application of AI in Cybersecurity

Beyond my research, I enjoy connecting with the community on **LinkedIn** [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carollokyi/) and participating in challenges on **TryHackMe** (ID: carol.lo). Feel free to connect with me on these platforms.
